        <p>Bitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, has been around for over a decade now. It has captured the imagination of people all over the world, as it is decentralized, borderless, and operates independently of any central authority. Bitcoin has proven to be a profitable investment for many, with its value soaring to new heights over the years.</p>

        <p>However, despite its success, there is a group of people who have been unable to capitalize on the rise of Bitcoin â€“ those who suffer from paper hands. In the world of cryptocurrencies, paper hands refer to people who sell their holdings too quickly, typically due to fear or panic. In other words, these individuals lack the mental fortitude to hold onto their investments through market volatility.</p>

        <p>One of the most significant challenges faced by people with paper hands is holding onto Bitcoin over the years. Bitcoin's value can be extremely volatile, and there have been times when it has experienced sharp drops in price. For those who panic at the first sign of trouble, these drops can be too much to handle, and they end up selling their Bitcoin at a loss.</p>

        <p>So what can be done to avoid paper handing Bitcoin over the years? One strategy is to focus on the long-term. Bitcoin is still a relatively new asset, and its true potential is still unknown. By holding onto your Bitcoin for a longer period, you increase your chances of profiting from its potential growth.</p>

        <p>Another strategy is to stay informed about the cryptocurrency market. By keeping up to date with the latest news and trends, you can make more informed decisions about when to buy, sell, or hold your Bitcoin.</p>

        <p>In conclusion, paper-handing Bitcoin over the years is one of the hardest trades to make. However, with the right mindset and strategy, it is possible to hold onto your Bitcoin through market volatility and potentially profit from its growth in the long run.</p>
